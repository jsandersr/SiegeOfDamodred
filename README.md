I'm really, really sorry for the code you're about to see. I don't know how this game manages to work even a little bit. The code is literally all over the place. Its important to note that this game was built organically with no prior knowledge of C# and only a year of programming classes before. I was only on year 2 of college.

That said, please use this safety pig to keep you safe as you explore the code inside.
